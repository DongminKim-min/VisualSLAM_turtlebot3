# Visual SLAM Project — RGB-D Graph-based SLAM(ROS1 / RTAB-Map)

> Deployed RTAB-Map RGB-D SLAM on TurtleBot3 running on Jetson Xavier NX and validated mapping/localization in RViz(visualization tool).

## Overview
This project demonstrates an **RGB-D, graph-based SLAM** pipeline on a mobile robot.
- **SLAM:** RTAB-Map (loop-closure + graph optimization)
- **Visualization:** RViz
- **Deployment:** Jetson Xavier NX (SSH remote), ROS1 environment

## Mapping
Note that there's an issue in loop closing!
I addressed this issue and there's a refined version below.

## System Setup

### Hardware
- Jetson Xavier NX
- TurtleBot3(Waffle Pi)
- openCR
- Intel RealSense RGB-D camera(D455i)

### Software / Libraries
- Ubuntu: 20.04(Jetson)
- ROS: ROS 1(Noetic)
- SLAM: RTAB-Map (`rtabmap_ros`)
- Visualization: RViz
- Sensor driver: `realsense2_camera` (Intel RealSense SDK)

## Graph-based SLAM
We performed multiple loop traversals so that RTAB-Map could accumulate loop-closure constraints and reduce pose estimation error via graph-based least-squares optimization.

## Issues

### Topic Synchronization Issue (Early Mapping Problem)
- Problem
  Topics such as `rgb_image`, `aligned_depth_to_color_image`, `color_camera_info`, and `odometry` were published with different timestamps.
  RTAB-Map dropped many messages due to poor synchronization.
- Solution
  Enabled approximate time synchronization `approx sync`
  Tuned subscriber `queue_size`

### Loop Closure Reliability
- Problem
  Loop closure often relies on visual features; it can be weaker in low-texture environments.
  Needed a way to monitor and improve loop-closure acceptance/rejection.
- Actions
  Monitored loop-closure status via RViz/RTAB-Map logs
  Tuned relevant RTAB-Map parameters `thresholds` and `OptimizeMaxError`
